# keras_segmentation
Keras segmentation models, Attention Unet, Fusion Net, and Lane Net

Image Segmentation using neural networks (NNs), designed for extracting the road network from remote sensing imagery and it can be used in other applications labels every pixel in the image (Semantic segmentation) 

Details can be found in these papers:

* [Unet: Convolutional Networks for Biomedical Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.04597)
* [Attention U-Net: Learning Where to Look for the Pancreas](https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.03999)
* [FusionNet: A deep fully residual convolutional neural network
for image segmentation in connectomics([https://arxiv.org/pdf/1612.05360.pdf])

## Requirements
* Python 3.6
* CUDA 10.0
* Keras 2.0
